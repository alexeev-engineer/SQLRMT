> **SQLRMT** is blazing fast software for connecting and managing your SQL databases in Python!

SQLRMT is asynchronous, uses network traffic protection mechanisms and is extensible.

> [!CAUTION]
> **SQLRMT currently only supports Linux distributions.** Other operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, BSD are not supported.

> [!CAUTION]
> At the moment, SQLRMT is under active development, many things may not work, and this version is not recommended for use (all at your own risk).

## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> SQLRMT offers the use of a client-server model without the ability to connect multiple clients to one server address.

To run the software you will have to install the necessary programs and dependencies, such as:

 + Python interpreter (>=3.10)
 + PIP package manager (>=22.0)
 + Python libraries (listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt))
 + openssl (>=3.0)

## Installing
If you want to download a stable release, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/alexeev-engineer/SQLRMT/releases). If you want to install the latest git version, then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeev-engineer/SQLRMT.git
cd SQLRMT
```

2. Create a working virtual environment and install dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> If your shell is fish, then instead of `source venv/bin/activate` use `source venv/bin/activate.fish`.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Done! ðŸ’ª ðŸŽ‰  You're ready to use SQLRMT!

## Configuration
Before starting, you need to create or modify a configuration file `sqlrmt.ini`. The configuration file must be stored either in the program's working directory or in the path `/etc/sqlrmt.ini`

```ini
[Server]
host=127.0.0.1
port=8000

[Client]
database=database.sqlite
timeout=3
```

 + **Server** - server information
  - *host* - IP address (hostname)
  - *port* - port
 + **Client** - client information
  - *database* - path to connected database in server
  - *timeout* - timeout for connecting to server

## Launch and use
Before you start using SQLRMT, you must first create RSA keys to encrypt traffic!

> [!NOTE]
> If you need a different period, then change the value of the `-days` flag to the desired number of days.

To generate keys we will use openssl:

```bash
# client
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:3072 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout client.key -out client.crt

# server
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:3072 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

You used openssl to generate server and client keys and certificates. Below are explanations of the flags:

 + `-newkey` - creating a new key with RSA encryption and a length of 3072 bits
 + `-days` - certificate expiration date
 + `-nodes` - need to generate an unencrypted private key
 + `-x509` - specifies the output certificate format
 + `-keyout` - specifies the output file name

The files client.key, client.crt, server.key, server.crt should have appeared in the directory

All that remains is to start the SQLRMT server:

```bash
# client.crt, server.key, server.crt - these are the files we previously created
python3 sqlrmt.py --server --server-key 'server.key' --server-cert 'server.crt' --client-cert 'client.cert'
```

And launch SQLRMT client:

```bash
# client.crt, client.key, server.crt - these are the files we previously created
python3 sqlrmt.py --client --client-key 'client.key' --client-cert 'client.cert' --server-cert server.crt
```

## Functional
Here you can see what SQLRMT can already do and what else is planned to be added in the future:

 - [x] Asynchrony support
 - [x] Secure and protected connection
 - [ ] Extensions support
 - [ ] SQL Query Validation

## Schemes of work
A secure TLS connection is created between clients and the server with asynchronous traffic encryption using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. The advantage of this algorithm is that even if an attacker obtains the private keys, he will only be able to read past messages. This is called _forward secrecy_.

SQLRMT uses ssl, socket and asyncio to create an asynchronous secure connection.
